        This website (maybe app later) was started at NWAPW
        The homeless problem in Portland is horribly sad and 
        is a very grim situation for youth especially. The 
        goal of this project is to provide a one stop shop for
        homeless youth. Information is provided on local shelters
        (including current capacities), rights of homeless youth,
        and volunteer opportunities to help the homeless.
